Program Description
  This program loads levels that let a player play. The object of the game is 
  to, like the Streamline game, to reach the goal square from the start square.
  The player must move around using the arrow keys, and using 'u' key to undo
  their move. There are obstacles scattered throughout the levels and circle
  appear from past movements. When the player reaches the goal then the goal
  square takes up the whole screen then the game disappears if there are no more
  levels to complete.
